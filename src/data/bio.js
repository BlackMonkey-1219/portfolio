  "Hi! How are you doing? I hope everything is alright with you. Well, let me tell you about myself a little. I'm a self-taught full-stack developer. However, I'm a computer science undergraduate. I like to stay ahead of my peers. So I learn a lot by myself (I love to do so too). If you have any Frontend, Backend, or Desktop application development projects or Web scraping requests, feel free to contact me at {fiverr.com/cyberwolf}. By the way... I'm an introvert, so you know... I'm a little bit awkward at meetings. So if you can tell me what you want via text, it'll be great.";
